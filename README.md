Brief Description:<br>

In this Student Mentoring Management System, we intend to develop a web-based application providing the necessary services to connect students to freelance mentors. It enables an
easier method of interaction between students and mentors. All users of the program are first
greeted with an easy sign-up page. After logging into their respective accounts users can access
all the features our app has to provide.
Few highlights about the features of this web application are that students can enter
information regarding the course they would like to study and a search bar would provide a list
of mentors to choose from based on a particular subject/topic at various time slots. The student
can then proceed with the transaction for purchasing a session with the chosen mentor. After
a successful session, both students and mentors can rate each other and provide feedback on
various aspects. Students can also opt for multiple mentors in various subjects simultaneously.
Our web application also provides a resource sharing environment similar to an e-Library to
provide required course materials to the students as per their chosen subject. The system
planned is robust in nature.
The frontend of the web application is designed using React and Bootstrap for a
neat and elegant dashboard. The database is created using MySQL Workbench. The backend
connects the database using Node.js and Express.js.
<br>
The following system can be used by both Students and Mentors to connect with each
other. It has a user-friendly interface, hence it can be used without any prerequisite knowledge
of the system.<br>
